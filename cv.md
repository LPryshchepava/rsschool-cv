#### About myself:
My name is Liudzmila Pryshchepava. I graduated Belarusian State University, Chemistry Faculty in 2013. I'm pharmaceutical chemist. Since 2013 I've been working in pharmaceutical industry: first as a chemist-analyst (1 year), then I became Regulatory Affairs manager. I like my job, but I feel, that I already learned everything in this sphere and I'm bored. I would like to try Frontend/JavaScript and I'm sure that my successful accomplishment of the course will contribute my future career. No matter what I will do. My motto is: knowledge can never be useless.
